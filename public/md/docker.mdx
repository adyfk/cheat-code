Architecture
* **Client** 
  <desc clx='mt-5'>
    The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker<br/> 
    When you use commands such as <em>docker run</em>, the client sends these commands to dockerd (daemon)
  </desc>
* **Host / Daemon / Server**
  <desc>
    The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as 
    <em>images, containers, networks, and volumes</em>. <br/>
    A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
  </desc>
* **Registries**
  <desc>
    A Docker registry stores Docker images. <br/>
    Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. <br/> 
    You can even run your own private registry.
  </desc>
* **Docker Objects**
  <desc>  
    <b>Images</b> <br/>
    An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
    <hr/>
    <b>Container</b> <br/>
    Running Image, we can running multiple Image
    <hr/>
  </desc>

## Command

### Basic
```bash
  # information
  docker info
  # version client & host
  docker version

  # singin docker
  docker login
```

### Images
```bash
  # list docker images in server
  docker images

  # pull / download images from registry
  docker pull mongo
  # docker pull mongo:5.1

  # remove images
  # docker image rm [IMAGE ID | IMAGE_NAME]
  docker image rm mongo

  # create image with DockerFile
  # docker build [options] [location]
  #     --tag [name_image]:[version_image]
  docker build --tag app-golang:1.0 .
  
  # clone docker local / create new tag
  # docker tag [source_name:source_version] [target_name:target_version]
  docker tag app-golang:1.0 new_image:1.0

  # push image to registries
  # docker push [image_name]
  docker push new_image:1.0
```

### Container
```bash
  # list docker container in server running 
  # CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES
  docker container ls
  # list docker container in server running / not
  docker container ls --all

  # create container docker
  # docker container create [options] mongo
  # --name [name_container]
  # -p, --publish [port expose]:[port internal container]
  # -e, --env [name_env]:[value_env]
  docker container create 
    --name mongoserver 
    -p 8080:27017 
    -e E_START=CHEAT 
    -e E_END=CODE 
    mongo 

  # view specify container
  docker container inspect mongoserver

  # start container
  # docker conatiner start [...name_container]
  docker container start mongoserver

  # stop container
  # docker conatiner stop [...name_container]
  docker container stop mongoserver

  # remove container
  # docker container rm [...name_container]
  docker container rm mongoserver

```
## Network

One of the reasons Docker containers and services are so powerful is that you can connect them together, or connect them to non-Docker workloads. \
Docker containers and services do not even need to be aware that they are deployed on Docker,\
or whether their peers are also Docker workloads or not

```bash
  # docker network COMMAND
  # Manage networks
  # Commands:
  #   connect     Connect a container to a network
  #   create      Create a network
  #   disconnect  Disconnect a container from a network
  #   inspect     Display detailed information on one or more networks
  #   ls          List networks
  #   prune       Remove all unused networks
  #   rm          Remove one or more networks

  # create network
  docker network create my_network

  # show list network
  docker network ls

  # docker network connect [network_name] [container_name]
  # inspect your container to check if it has connect to network
  docker network connect my_network mongoserver
```

## Create Image

### DockerFile
```dockerfile
  # pull image from registry
  # FROM [name_image]:[image_version]
  FROM golang:1.11.4

  # copy local file's to directory image
  # COPY [source] [target]
  COPY . .

  CMD ["go", "run", "/app/main.go"]
```
